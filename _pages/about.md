I am Wei Shi (施为), a research scientist in Meta AI, with a focus on causal learning, recommendation system, generative AI and their applications in monetization. I obtained the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, under the supervision of Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/) (AI for chip design) and Prof. [Nan Sun](https://www.sunresearchgroup.top/zh/) (High-performance chip design).

As a ML enthusiast, a chip designer, and an anime fan, I've designed ML models, taped out chips, and dabbled in drawing mangas. AI is my most recent excitement :), it generates profits for people (monetization), builds its own computing bone (chip design), and produces creative arts (anime).
